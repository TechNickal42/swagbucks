# Swagbucks Bot
This is a swagbucks bot that automaticly answers the questions which gives you 2SB per 10 answered questions. 

To get this to work you need to install a webdriver for the browser that you use. 
You can download Chrome webdrivers through this link: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads download the driver that corresponds to your chrome version.
You also need to install selenium. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjv1sY630Uc this video will tell you how to install selenium and how to add a driver. 

Unfortunately there are only a limited amount of questions you can answer so the bot will stop pretty quickly. If you have a way to bypass this please let me know.
